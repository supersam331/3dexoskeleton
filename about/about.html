		</div>	
			<p>Elena Ramirez graduated in May 2015 from Lehigh University with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering. Elena and Jeff started this project their junior year to 3D print prosthetics for children. This was as an effort to provide inexpensive alternatives to users who rapidly outgrow these devices. While it has changed direction, this project fostered Elena’s passion for customized medical devices. </p>
			<br>
			<p>At Lehigh, Elena led her capstone-engineering project in Integrated Product Development (IPD), an entrepreneurial course where students work across disciplines with an industry-sponsor. Gentex Corporation brought her group’s work to market. She later served as a Senior Peer Mentor for IPD guiding the next group of engineers and business majors. Elena took part in Lehigh’s active Greek Life as a member of Alpha Chi Omega. </p>
			<br>	
			<p>Before Lehigh, Elena attended Santa Cruz High School in Santa Cruz, CA. She has also lived in New Jersey and New Mexico. In her spare time, she enjoys long-distance running and painting. </p>

		<p>Jeff Peisner graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Electrical Engineering in 2015. He was one of the original project members during summer 2014 with Elena Ramirez and Colleen Perry. Jeff came up with the design concept for the Wolverine in 2014 and further developed it in 2015. Jeff plans to work as a research fellow at Conor Walsh's lab at the Wyss Institute of Harvard University starting in August 2015. </p>

			<h2>Emily Macmillan</h2>

			<span class="byline">'16 Bioengineering</span>
		</div>
		<p>Emily Macmillan is a rising senior at Lehigh University and plans to graduate in May 2016 with a B.S in Bioengineering with a focus on biomechanics and biomaterials. She has always been interested in medical devices, specifically prosthetics and orthotics, ever since she was diagnosed with scoliosis as a child and wore a back brace for five years. She joined the mountaintop team for the summer of 2015 after hearing about the successful research that had been completed the previous summer.  </p>
 		<br>
		<p>While at Lehigh Emily has been involved with the research of transmembrane proteins and how their mutations could lead to different neurological disorders under Dr. Bryan Berger. She also has worked on a capstone engineering project in her Integrated Product Design class to develop a tool to assist surgeons in the closure of the spine during a pedicle subtraction osteotomy procedure. This device was designed with a team of peers in cross-disciplinary fields and sponsored by Aesculap. She is extremely involved with her sorority Zeta Tau Alpha and has served on the executive board for two years. She has also been actively involved with Lehigh’s Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) and will serve on their executive board for her senior year.  </p>
 		<br>	
		<p>Originally Emily is from Point Pleasant, New Jersey. Her hobbies include drawing, photography, and swimming.</p>
